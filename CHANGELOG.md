## [3.1.0] — LangChain4j + ChatBackend Unification

**v3.1.0** — 2026-06-21

This release rebuilds the AI subsystem on LangChain4j and unifies the two cloud providers (OpenAI + Anthropic) into a single `CloudChatBackend` class behind a new `ChatBackend` interface. Local mode (in-process GGUF) is renamed to `LocalChatBackend` but otherwise unchanged.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **`AiService` interface removed** — replaced by `ChatBackend`. External plugins calling `AiServiceProvider.getService()` must change the return type from `AiService` to `ChatBackend`. See [`docs/migration-3.1.md`](migration-3.1.md) for the migration guide.
- **`OpenAiService` and `AnthropicService` concrete classes removed** — replaced by a single `CloudChatBackend` class with `openAi(...)` / `anthropic(...)` static factories. One unified class serves both providers.
- **`CloudAiConfigProvider` and standalone `StreamingResponseHandlerBridge` removed** — their logic moved into `CloudChatBackend` (config accessors are public methods on the class; the stream bridge is a private inner class).
- **`AiServiceImpl` renamed to `LocalChatBackend`** — pure rename, no behavior change.

### ♻️ Changed

- **Unified `ChatBackend` interface** in `SwissKitJ-Api` — non-sealed (Java forbids cross-module sealed permits). Two known implementors: `CloudChatBackend`, `LocalChatBackend`. UI consumers use `instanceof` checks for backend-specific behavior; the `ChatBackend` interface itself is treated as opaque.
- **`CloudChatBackend` unifies OpenAI + Anthropic** in one class (~450 LOC). HTTP/SSE, tool-loop plumbing, and stream bridging are entirely delegated to LangChain4j's `OpenAiStreamingChatModel` / `AnthropicStreamingChatModel`. Provider-specific differences isolated to a `buildStreamingModel(...)` switch on an internal `Provider` enum.
- `SynchronousChatHelper` (browser planner) rewritten to use LC4j's synchronous `OpenAiChatModel` directly via `CloudChatBackend` config accessors.
- `AiServiceProvider` exposes `ChatBackend` everywhere. Method names unchanged (`getService()`, `switchMode(...)`, `registerTool()`, etc.).
- Sampling parameters (temperature / topP / maxTokens) are now honoured per-call instead of being baked into a cached model — settings changes take effect on the next message without restarting the chat.

### ✨ New

- New `ChatBackend` interface (`fan.summer.api.ai.ChatBackend`)
- New `CloudChatBackend` class with `openAi(...)` / `anthropic(...)` factories
- `LocalChatBackend` (renamed from `AiServiceImpl`)
- `AiToolCall.of(id, name, arguments)` overload to preserve server-issued tool-call IDs when bridging from LangChain4j
- `CloudChatBackendTest` (11 tests) + adapter tests for `ChatMessageMapper` / `AiToolToToolSpecification` (~17 tests)
- Migration guide at [`docs/migration-3.1.md`](migration-3.1.md) (EN + ZH) — covers type rename, `instanceof` migration, factory call patterns, custom backend extension

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`testConnection()` null-message bug on macOS**: previously, `ConnectException` from an unreachable endpoint carried a `null` message on macOS JDKs, causing `testConnection()` to return `null` (interpreted as success by the Settings UI). Now falls back to `e.getClass().getSimpleName() + ": " + e` so the error always surfaces.
- **Anthropic multi-round tool calling**: server-issued `tool_use_id` is now preserved through the `AiToolCall → LangChain4j → AiToolCall` round-trip — previously a fabricated local ID caused HTTP 400 on tool round 2.
- **Multi-turn conversation continuity**: the assistant's final reply is now appended to `history` before the service returns (callers like `AiChatPlugin` relied on this and were silently losing context).
- **OpenAI tool-round message ordering**: the assistant-with-tools message is now appended before `ToolExecutor.executeAndFeed`, satisfying the API contract that `tool` messages must follow an `assistant` with `tool_calls`.
- `testConnection()` `HttpClient` wrapped in try-with-resources (Java 21 `AutoCloseable`).
- Thread-safety hardening on the cloud stream handler (`StringBuffer` accumulator, `volatile` fields).

### ⬆️ Dependencies

- `dev.langchain4j:langchain4j-open-ai:1.2.0`
- `dev.langchain4j:langchain4j-anthropic:1.2.0`
- (1.0.1 was originally pinned but `langchain4j-anthropic` was never published at that version; bumped to the lowest GA where both modules co-exist)

### ⚠️ Known Behavior Changes

- `cancelGeneration()` on cloud backends is now best-effort (LangChain4j 1.x does not expose mid-stream cancellation on streaming models); the in-progress flag is still cleared. Local mode is unaffected.
- Mid-stream SSE errors now surface via `callback.onError` on the JavaFX Application Thread, same as existing local-mode behaviour.

### 📉 Net Code Change

- Deleted: `AiService` (117 LOC), `OpenAiService` (244 LOC), `AnthropicService` (283 LOC), `CloudAiConfigProvider` (22 LOC), `StreamingResponseHandlerBridge` (120 LOC), `StreamingResponseHandlerBridgeTest` (214 LOC) ≈ **1000 LOC removed**
- Added: `ChatBackend` (86 LOC), `CloudChatBackend` (450 LOC), `CloudChatBackendTest` (87 LOC), adapter tests, migration guides (244 LOC) ≈ **1100 LOC added**
- Net: roughly even on LOC, but cloud code is now one unified class instead of two parallel implementations.

## [3.0.1] — FunctionGemma Offline Adaptation

**v3.0.1** — 2026-06-21

### ✨ New Features

- **FunctionGemma Multi-Round Tool Loop**: Host-driven `analyze → configure → execute` loop for the FunctionGemma-270m-it local model; tool-call tokens are suppressed during call rounds and only the final response is forwarded to the UI
- **Offline CN→EN Keyword Normalizer**: `OfflineNlNormalizer` rewrites Chinese tool-name keywords to English before local-model parsing, no network required (resource-backed `nl-normalizer.properties`)
- **Enum-Schema Tool Parameters**: `AiToolParam` gains an `enumValues` field; tool declarations now emit `enum:[...]` constraints to FunctionGemma, OpenAI, and Anthropic backends — materially improves small-model parameter reliability
- Enriched Excel AI tool descriptions and added enum constraints on `mode`/`action` parameters

### 🐛 Fixes

- Harden `FunctionGemmaAdapter` parser: 🪙 (U+1FA99) string delimiter correctly handles values containing commas, braces, and multiple tool calls in a single response
- Release `GGUFModel` mmap on unload via best-effort `unmap`
- Harden `GGUFReader` against malformed or truncated model files
- Serialise `PluginLoader` JAR load/unload on a single-thread scheduler
- Complete `LlamaRunner` generation cleanly when cancelled during prefill
- Drive `TokenBatcher` flushes off the FX thread
- Let the native AI worker exit gracefully before force-killing it
- Close target POI `Workbook` in `ExcelUtil` even when copy/write throws
- Low-priority stability cleanup (MDI font log, daemon UI threads)

**v3.0.0-rc.2** — 2026-06-05

- **Tool Favorites**: Bookmark tools with a star toggle on tool cards and the detail panel; favorites persist across restarts via H2 database and are filterable from the sidebar "Favorites" category
- **Lazy AI Backend**: Local AI backend (native/Java) initialization is deferred until the AI tool is first opened, improving startup performance; Java/Native inference engine toggle in AI settings
- **Plugin Uninstall**: Uninstall external plugins from the detail panel with confirmation dialog; closes ClassLoader, removes JAR file, and cleans up from registry
- **Install Toast Notifications**: Success toast notification when a plugin is installed from the online store or local JAR
- **Token Batching**: AI token output is batched at 50ms intervals to reduce FX thread flooding during high-speed generation
- **Crash Rate Limiting**: Native worker auto-restart respects a time window (3 crashes within 5 min) to prevent restart storms
- **Settings Cache**: App settings are cached in memory with debounced DB writes (300ms) to reduce database load during rapid UI interaction
- Fix native library loading on hardened Linux distros (UOS/Deepin/Kylin) where `SecurityException` is thrown for unsigned `.so` files
- Fix email batch sending mutating shared recipient lists across iterations
- Fix online store plugin catalog parsing — replaced hand-rolled string slicing with Gson-based `JsonHelper`
- Fix `WindowResizeHelper` double-attachment causing duplicate event filters
- Thread-safety hardening across `PluginLoader`, `PluginRegistry`, and `MainWindow` (`ConcurrentHashMap`, `volatile`, `synchronizedSet`)
- Stagger limit for tool card entry animations (max 30) to avoid creating hundreds of `PauseTransition` instances
- Fix plugin JAR deletion on Windows — retry with `System.gc()` hint, fall back to `deleteOnExit()` if file is still locked
- Fix `onUnload()` lifecycle callback not fired when unloading plugin JARs
- Fix cached plugin view not cleared when uninstalling an inactive plugin, preventing GC of plugin classes
- Fix English locale (`Locale.ENGLISH`) returning Chinese strings on Chinese-locale systems — `ResourceBundle` no longer falls back to JVM default locale
- Fix Windows no-JRE release zip redundantly including the fat JAR alongside the Launch4j exe (which already embeds it)

---

**v3.0.0-rc.1** — 2026-06-04

- **Browser Automation**: AI-callable `browser_automate` tool that automates web browsers via natural language; uses Playwright with the system's installed Chrome/Edge/Chromium (no separate browser download); observe-think-act loop with page DOM snapshots, CSS selector targeting, and a planner LLM
- **Resizable Window**: Edge and corner drag resize for the undecorated `StageStyle.TRANSPARENT` window via `WindowResizeHelper`; uses screen coordinates for macOS compatibility
- **Responsive Layout**: Dynamic `FlowPane` wrap length bound to viewport width; `windowPane` and `ContentArea` properly fill parent with `setMaxWidth/Height(Double.MAX_VALUE)`
- **Pure Java PDF-to-DOCX**: `PdfBoxToDocxConverter` using PDFBox for extraction and Apache POI for DOCX generation — no external Office installation required; three-tier page strategy (text → extracted images → full-page render fallback)
- **Native Backend Health Tracking**: `NativeLoader.FailureReason` enum for structured failure diagnostics; degraded-mode banner in AI chat when native acceleration is unavailable
- Fix macOS window resize not working due to unreliable `stage.isMaximized()` with `StageStyle.TRANSPARENT`
- Fix tool grid layout not responsive to window width changes
- Fix Playwright runtime attempting to download browser driver unnecessarily
- Fix AI browser planner recursively invoking `browser_automate` tool via tool injection loop
